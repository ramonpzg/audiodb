    "A vector database is a type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. In traditional [OLTP](https://www.ibm.com/topics/oltp) and [OLAP](https://www.ibm.com/topics/olap) databases, data is organized in rows and columns, and queries are performed based on the values in those columns. However, in certain applications including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, data is often represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Here is a depiction of all three next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dbs](../images/databases.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector in this context is a mathematical representation of an object or data point, where each element of the vector corresponds to a specific feature or attribute of the object. For example, in an image recognition system, a vector could represent an image, with each element of the vector representing a pixel value or a descriptor/characteristic of that pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are optimized for **storing** and **querying** these high-dimensional vectors efficiently, often using specialized data structures and indexing techniques such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), Approximate Nearest Neighbors, and Product Quantization, among others. These databases enable fast similarity and semantic search while allowing users to find vectors that are the closest to a given query vector based on some distance metric. The most commonly used distance metrics are Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, and Dot Product."

    "\n",
    "In addition, other benefits of using vector databases include:\n",
    "1. Efficient storage and indexing of high-dimensional data.\n",
    "3. Ability to handle large-scale datasets with billions or trillions of data points.\n",
    "4. Support for real-time analytics and queries.\n",

Think of it like a ruler that tells you how far apart two points are, but instead of measuring distance, it measures how similar two things are. It's often used with text to compare how similar two documents or sentences are to each other. The output of the cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means the two things are completely dissimilar, and 1 means the two things are exactly the same. It's a straightforward and effective way to compare two things!\n",
    "- [**Dot Product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) - The dot product similarity metric is another way of measuring how similar two things are, like cosine similarity. It's often used in machine learning and data science when working with numbers. The dot product similarity is calculated by multiplying the values in two sets of numbers, and then adding up those products. The higher the sum, the more similar the two sets of numbers are. So, it's like a scale that tells you how closely two sets of numbers match each other.\n",
    "- [**Euclidean Distance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) - Euclidean distance is a way to measure the distance between two points in space, similar to how we measure the distance between two places on a map. It's calculated by finding the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the two points' coordinates. This distance metric is commonly used in machine learning to measure how similar or dissimilar two data points are or, in other words, to understand how far apart they are.\n",

    "The most common use case you will find at the time of writing, will likely involve language-based models. You might have heard of models like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex), and [PaLM-2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2) which are powering incredible tools such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and [Bard](https://bard.google.com/?hl=en), respectively. These three models are part of a family of deep learning architectures called [transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Which are known for their ability to learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence, and that makes them well-suited for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models work by using a technique called attention, which allows them to focus on different parts of a sentence when making predictions. For example, if you are trying to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, the transformer model will use attention to focus on the words in the English sentence that are most important for the translation into Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "One analogy that can be used to explain transformer models is to think of them as a group of people who are trying to solve a puzzle. Each person in the group is given a different piece of the puzzle, and they need to work together to figure out how the pieces fit together. The transformer model is like the group of people, and the attention mechanism is like the way that the people in the group communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more concise way, transformer models are a type of machine learning model that can learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence by using (or paying 😉) attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, vector databases are used to store word embeddings. Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture their semantic meaning. They are used to improve the performance of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part about transformers the models, and `transformers` the Python library, is that we can get these embeddings in very straightforward way.\n",

    "Before we get started with the model, let's talk about the use case we will be covering here.\n",
